## 💡 Overview

**Foodtracker App** is a **multi-stack, microservice-oriented** project designed to explore how different technologies can work together to build scalable applications.

The project includes:

- 🧩 **Core service** – built with **Django REST Framework**
- 🔐 **Auth service** – implemented with **Nest.js** and **JWT authentication**
- 🌉 **API Gateway** – managing communication between services
- 💻 **React frontend** for the web
- 🍏 *(Experimental)* **Swift desktop app** for iOS/macOS clients

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🍽️ Create and manage meals and nutrition data  
- 🔐 User authentication using JWT  
- 📦 Microservice communication via internal APIs  
- 🌐 React web interface  
- 🧱 MongoDB and PostgreSQL for data storage  
- ⚙️ Modular, scalable code structure for future expansion  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| **API Gateway** | Nest.js |
| **Core Backend** | Django REST Framework |
| **Auth Backend** | Nest.js (JWT Auth) |
| **Frontend** | React.js |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB |
| **Language** | Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Swift |

---

## 🧠 Project Motivation

This project was built as a **technical playground** to understand and implement:
- Communication between **microservices**
- JWT authentication flow across different frameworks
- API Gateway pattern
- Combining **Python (DRF)** and **TypeScript (Nest.js)** in one ecosystem

Even though the app is still **in development**, it reflects:
- Comfort working across **multiple backends**
- Real-world **service separation**
- Ability to integrate **frontend and backend** technologies smoothly
